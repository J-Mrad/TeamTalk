# TeamTalk
Office chat web application

Team Talk is an office chat application made as per request of IDS as part of the internship program, catered to the needs of any company from small startups to large businesses. It offers a simplistic design coupled with a layered coding schema that makes best use of web development frameworks to give the user a great experience. Team Talk facilitates the communication between colleagues/team members through text messaging and even sharing images. Everything is managed on a database to prevent any data loss and any access to the system is done through a login system for added security.
Equipped with different roles with the possibility of expansion and the ability to host multiple companies simultaneously, the system is very customizable. TT can also be fitted to host multiple teams within the same company with the possibility of having all cross-team communication on a secure, manageable system.





TeamTalk aims to provide a reliable alternative to time-consuming email conversations and pointless conference calls that still offers security and the ability to share images and documents both online and offline. The application can be used in any office setting with different assignable roles to allow managers more control. TeamTalk relies on simplicity and minimalism in design which allows us to reach out to a broader audience and in turn boost usability.
